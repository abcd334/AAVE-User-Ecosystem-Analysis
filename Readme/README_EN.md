## Part 1: AAVE Development History

### Transaction Volume Across Different Blockchains
![image](../image/Transaction_Count.jpg)

This section highlights transaction volume trends on various blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.) over time:

1. **Ethereum**:
    - **V2 Peak Activity**: In its early stages (2021), Ethereum consistently exhibited high transaction volumes, underscoring its role as the foundational core of the AAVE protocol.
    - **Impact of V3 Deployment**: Following the introduction of V3, transaction volumes slightly increased but generally stabilized.

2. **Polygon**:
    - **Explosive Growth**: Transaction volumes surged significantly after Polygon’s deployment in early 2021, demonstrating the appeal of its low transaction fees.
    - **Stabilization**: After 2022, transaction volumes decreased and maintained a steady trend.

3. **Avalanche**:
    - **Short-Term Peak**: Avalanche experienced a significant spike in transaction volumes shortly after its late 2021 deployment, followed by a rapid decline, indicating limited market acceptance.

4. **Other Blockchains**:
    - Transaction volumes on other blockchains showed periodic spikes, such as the slight boost in Ethereum’s activity due to new features introduced in V3.

**Conclusion**  
Blockchain deployments initially drive significant transaction volume increases. However, as the market matures, transaction volumes stabilize. Ethereum remains the mainstream platform, while low-cost chains like Polygon excel in their early stages.

### Changes in Transaction Types
![image](../image/Transaction_Type_Count.jpg)

This section analyzes daily transaction counts for various transaction types on AAVE, including **Supply**, **FlashLoan**, **Borrow**, **Repay**, **Liquidation**, and **Withdraw**:

1. **Supply**:
    - **Peak Period**: Notable peaks were observed in 2021 and early 2022, likely driven by growing demand for stable returns.
    - **Stable Period**: Post-2023, Supply transactions stabilized, indicating steady long-term capital inflows.

2. **FlashLoan**:
    - **Short-Term Surges**: Significant spikes in 2021 and early 2024 were likely due to arbitrage opportunities or market volatility.
    - **Instability**: FlashLoan activity displayed explosive growth followed by rapid declines, indicative of its reliance on professional traders.

3. **Borrow and Repay**:
    - **Synchronized Fluctuations**: Borrow and Repay volumes exhibited tandem movements, reflecting consistent borrowing and repayment behavior.
    - **2024 Peak**: A recent surge in transaction volumes suggests renewed borrowing demand, potentially linked to market interest rates or asset needs.

4. **Liquidation**:
    - **Sparse but Impactful**: While overall Liquidation volumes were low, concentrated spikes occurred during periods of market volatility (e.g., late 2021), indicating that Liquidation behavior is primarily influenced by market conditions.

5. **Withdraw**:
    - **Stable with Occasional Peaks**: Withdraw volumes were generally stable but saw occasional surges, likely due to market panic or increased liquidity demands.

**Conclusion**  
Supply and Borrow/Repay activities form the stable foundation of the AAVE protocol. In contrast, FlashLoan and Liquidation activities are more sensitive to market conditions. Recent transaction peaks in 2024 merit further investigation into potential causes such as market volatility or protocol upgrades.
